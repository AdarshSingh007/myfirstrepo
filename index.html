        <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><i>From January 1863 </i></b> to  <b><i>July 1902</i></b> </p>
        <h3>Introduction </h3>
        <div>
            <b>Vivekanda</b>, original name <b>Narendranath Datta</b>, Datta also spelled Dutt, (born January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now Kolkata]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta), Hindu spiritual leader and reformer in India who attempted to combine
            Indian spirituality with Western material progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and complemented one another. His Absolute was a person’s own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity was the noblest 
            endeavour.
            Born into an upper-middle-class family of the Kayastha (scribes) caste in Bengal, he was educated at a Western-style university where he was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science. Social reform became a 
            prominent element of Vivekananda’s thought, and he joined the Brahmo Samaj (Society of Brahma), dedicated to eliminating child marriage and illiteracy and determined to spread education among women and the lower castes. He
            later became the most-notable disciple of Ramakrishna, who demonstrated the essential unity of all religions.
            Always stressing the universal and humanistic side of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism, as well as belief in service rather than dogma, Vivekananda attempted to infuse vigour into Hindu thought, placing less 
            emphasis on the prevailing pacifism and presenting Hindu spirituality to the West. He was an activating force in the movement to promote Vedanta philosophy (one of the six schools of Indian philosophy) in the United States and England. In 1893 he appeared in Chicago as a spokesman for Hinduism at the World’s Parliament of Religions and so captivated the assembly that a newspaper account described him as “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament.” Thereafter he lectured throughout the United States and England, making converts to the Vedanta movement.

        <h3>Earlier Life education</h3>
        <p>
            born Narendranath Dutta, into an affluent Bengali family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was one of the eight
             children of Vishwanath Dutta and Bhuvaneshwari Devi. He was born on January 12, 1863, on the occasion 
             of Makar Sankranti. Father Vishwanath was a successful attorney with considerable influence in society.
              Narendranath’s mother Bhuvaneshwari was a woman endowed with a strong, God-fearing mind who had a great
               impact on her son. 
             As a young boy, Narendranath displayed sharp intellect. His mischievous nature belied his interest in music, both instrumental as well as vocal. He excelled in his studies as well, first at the Metropolitan institution, and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. By the time he graduated from the college, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling and body building. He was an avid reader and read up on almost everything under the sun. He perused the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads on one hand, while on the other hand he studied 
             western philosophy, history and spirituality by David Hume, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Herbert Spencer.

        <h3>Spiritual Crisis and Relationship with Ramkrishna Paramhansa</h3>
        <p>
            Although Narendranath’s mother was a devout woman and he had grown up in a religious atmosphere at home, he
            underwent a deep spiritual crisis at the start of his youth. His well-studied knowledge led him to question
            the existence of God and for some time he believed in Agnosticism. Yet he could not completely ignore the
            existence of a Supreme Being. He became associated with Brahmo Movement led by Keshab Chandra Sen, for 
            some time. The Bramho Samaj recognised one God unlike the idol-worshipping, superstition-ridden Hinduism. 
            The host of philosophical questions regarding the existence of God roiling through his mind remained unanswered. 
            During this spiritual crisis, Vivekananda first heard about Sri Ramakrishna from William Hastie, the Principal of
            the Scottish Church College.
            Earlier, to satisfy his intellectual quest for God, Narendranath visited prominent spiritual leaders from all religions, asking 
            them a single question, “Have you seen God?” Each time he came away without a satisfying answer. He put forward the same question 
            to Sri Ramkrishna at his residence in Dakshinewar Kali Temple compounds. Without a moment's hesitation, Sri Ramakrishna replied: 
            "Yes, I have. I see God as clearly as I see you, only in a much deeper sense." Vivekananda, initially unimpressed by the simplicity of Ramkrishna, was astonished with Ramakrishna's reply. Ramakrishna gradually won over this argumentative young man with his patience and love. The more Narendranath visited Dakshineshwar, the more his questions were answered.
